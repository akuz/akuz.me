      <p>For years I’ve wanted to build a super-dense electronic-music compressor: keep only the loops and phase cues that really matter, then re-synthesise the track perfectly. Evenings and weekends, however, were never long enough to design the model, write the maths, and wrangle PyTorch. Recently I opened ChatGPT running the new o3 model and treated it as a design partner. If we could keep the conversation focused, perhaps we could sketch—and prototype—the entire idea in a single stretch.</p>
<h2 id="co-designing-the-generative-model">Co-designing the generative model</h2>
<p>We started by deciding how the data should look. I wanted a phase-aware spectrogram—complex numbers on an 
<code>𝐹 × 𝑁</code> grid—rebuilt from a handful of reusable patterns and a sparse list of occurrences. I proposed details; o3 replied with equations. We swapped <code>3 × 3</code> windows for <code>5 × 5</code>, removed global gains then re-introduced per-occurrence magnitudes, and replaced hard clamping with bilinear interpolation so gradients would flow. After several iterations we froze a checkpoint: unit-normalised patterns, fractional offsets encoded as phases, occurrences positioned by two complex numbers rather than fixed indices. o3 typeset the whole formulation in LaTeX, and I compiled it into a <a href="/pdfs/2025_04_co_model_spec.pdf">concise PDF</a>.</p>
<h2 id="implementingand-debuggingthe-first-learning-loop">Implementing—and debugging—the first learning loop</h2>
<p>o3 then produced a clean repo: separate modules for patterns, occurrences, a differentiable lattice writer, and a training script. The first run showed falling loss yet every pattern remained zero. In chat we traced the issue to hard gates that silenced magnitudes before gradients could reach them; replacing the mask with soft weights solved the problem immediately, and patterns began to develop non-zero amplitudes and phases. For visibility we added a simple ASCII heat-map that printed the target spectrogram, the reconstruction, and their difference directly in the terminal.</p>
<h2 id="one-working-day-later">One working day later...</h2>
<p>By the evening the model could reconstruct a synthetic test grid with a small dictionary and far fewer occurrences than pixels. No extensive design document, no weekend-long coding marathon—just a day of iterative conversation with an AI partner. Next steps are clear: push the code to GitHub, train on real electronic tracks, and measure how low we can take the bitrate. </p>
<p>See github repository <a href="https://github.com/akuz/o3_codec_experiment_apr_2025">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-this-prototype-different">What makes this prototype different</h2>
<p>The crucial detail is that occurrences are not tied to the lattice. Each centre is stored as two unit-complex numbers whose phases map to continuous coordinates, so patterns can be placed anywhere—even between grid cells—while gradients still flow. A single pattern can therefore be reused at arbitrary offsets instead of being cloned for every shift. This first experiment shows that phase-parametrised placement can turn a dense spectrogram into a sparse set of grid-free building blocks, opening the door to extremely compact music compression.</p>
