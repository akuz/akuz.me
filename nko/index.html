      <p>This is the personal website of Andrey Kuzmenko.</p>
<p>I am an applied mathematician, software engineer, and quantitative analyst, experienced with — and deeply interested in — Machine Learning (ML), Large Language Models (LLMs), transformer-based architectures, deep neural networks (ConvNets, LSTMs, and their successors), probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), and Bayesian inference. I have a strong foundation in linear algebra and optimization, and a passion for applying these tools in real-world contexts.</p>
<p>I currently write a lot of Python, C++, and Swift/Metal code, but I also have years of experience with Java, JavaScript, C, C#, and SQL — and an ability to pick up new languages quickly (I’ve even worked in BASIC, Perl, Pascal/Delphi, and ASP over the years). My favorite areas of application include natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), quantitative finance, and more recently, deep-learning-based electronic music generation (still shallowly explored for now).</p>
<p>I live in Oxford with my husband and our baby son. Outside of work, I enjoy skiing, exploring traditional wellness practices, and building AI side-projects that serve real human needs.</p>
